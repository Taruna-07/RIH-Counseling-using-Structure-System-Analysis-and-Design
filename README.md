The Counseling Center at UMBC, a part of Retriever Integrated Health (RIH), currently relies on a manual appointment scheduling process. This system requires students to call during business hours, resulting in inefficiencies and potential errors. To address these challenges and better serve UMBC students, our team proposed the development of an integrated self-service scheduling application.

Technology Used:
• Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
• Backend: Node.js, Express.js
• Database: MongoDB
• Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

Our solution aimed to automate the appointment scheduling process, reduce errors, and enhance student convenience. The user-friendly application enables students to schedule appointments at their convenience, select preferred counselors, and complete paperwork in advance. By leveraging modern web technologies, we successfully streamlined the counseling appointment process, ultimately improving the overall student experience at UMBC.
